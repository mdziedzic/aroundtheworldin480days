							<h1>Tasmania to Cape Town by Land*</h1>

							<h2>A gallivanting gallimaufry spanning 480 days and 34 countries. Offbeat characters, teeming markets, amazing architecture, unforgettable meals. Questionable transport through ever-changing landscapes. A standoff or two (or three) with the locals. A circus bear and at least one over-caffeinated monkey. Even a drunken role-player. And probably a bit too much of the local beer (wine, mead, whisky, tej, waragiâ€¦). Oh, and lots of mosquitos. Along the way we took some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aroundtheworldin480days/sets/" title="Photos">photos</a> (here are our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aroundtheworldin480days/sets/72157624185440774/" title="Favorite photos">favorites</a>).</h2>

							<p class="body-text-first-home"><span id="big-asterix">*</span>And a few bits of river and sea, but really, almost entirely by land.</p>
							<p class="body-text-home">And, well, to be perfectly honest, really more Indonesia to South Africa by surface as a flight from Perth to Bali was needed to get up and out of the land down under.</p>
							<p class="body-text-home">And, while we are at it, though we did spend a good amount of effort trying, the land borders between Thailand and Myanmar were closed, and despite considerable effort and contemplated bribery, we had to take a short round-trip flight between Chiang Mai, Thailand and Yangon to get in and out of Myanmar.</p>
							<p class="body-text-home">And in the interest of full disclosure, a small prop plane in Ethiopia from Lalibela to Addis Ababa as we had already done the trip in reverse by bus, it was near the end our trip, and we were running out steam (money, and, quite frankly, the will to live).</p>
