							<h1>Tasmania to Cape Town by Land<sup class="sup-h1">&dagger;</sup></h1>

							<h2>A 34-country, 480-day, 30,000-mile gallivanting gallimaufry of offbeat characters in faraway places; delights architectural, foods unforgettable; dubious transport through landscapes untold; a standoff or two (or three) with touts and the law; a circus bear; at least one over-stimulated monkey; and a bit too much of the local beer.<sup>&Dagger;</sup> Oh, and lots of mosquitos. Along the way we took some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aroundtheworldin480days/sets/" title="Photos">photos</a> (here are some of our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aroundtheworldin480days/sets/72157624185440774/" title="Favorite photos">favorites</a>).</h2>

							<p class="body-text-first-home"><sup>&dagger;</sup>And a few bits of river and sea, but really, almost entirely by land.</p>
							<p class="body-text-home">And, well, to be perfectly honest, really more Indonesia to South Africa by surface as a flight from Perth to Bali was needed to get up and out of the Land Down Under.</p>
							<p class="body-text-home">And, while we are at it, though we did spend a fair amount of effort trying, the land border between Thailand and Myanmar was closed, and despite considerable effort and contemplated bribery, we had to take a short round-trip flight between Chiang Mai, Thailand and Yangon to get in and out of Myanmar.</p>
							<p class="body-text-home">And in the interest of full disclosure, a small prop plane in Ethiopia from Lalibela to Addis Ababa as we had already done the trip in reverse by bus, it was near the end our trip, and we were running out steam (money, and, quite frankly, the will to live).</p>

							<p class="body-text-first-home"><sup>&Dagger;</sup>Wine, whisky, vodka, mead, waragi, arak, betel, kef, tej...</p>
