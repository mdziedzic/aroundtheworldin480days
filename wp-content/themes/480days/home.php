							<h1>Australia to South Africa, entirely by land.*</h1>
							<h2>A 34-country odyssey involving unreasonable monkeys, malaria, rashes, leeches, scuffles with locals, stand off with military police, great joy, deep despair, and probably a bit too much of the local beer.</h2>

							<p class="body-text-first-home">*And a few bits of river and sea, but really, mostly land.</p>
							<p class="body-text-home">And, well, to be perfectly honest, really more Singapore to Cape Town, South Africa by land as a flight from Perth, Australia to Bali, Indonesia because some Aussie holiday messed up our plans of taking a ferry from Darwin.</p> 
							<p class="body-text-home">And, while we are at it, though we did spend a good amount of effort trying, the land borders between Thailand and Myanmar were closed, even to considerable efforts and contemplated bribery, so we had to take a small round-trip flight between Chiang Mai, Thailand and Yangon.</p>
							<p class="body-text-home">And in the interest of full disclosure, a small prop plane in Ethiopia from Lalibella to Addis Ababa, mainly to save time as we did go from Addis Abab to Lalibella by land.</p>
							<p class="body-text-home">And really, it was 480 days plus or minus a few as it took us awhile to make it back home once we got back to the U.S., had to catch up with friends and family.</p>
