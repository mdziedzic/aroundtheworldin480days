							<p class="body-text-first">We are a married couple in our mid-30s (at the time of the trip) from Portland, Oregon. We met at work in Boston, got married, and not too long after decided to quit our jobs and drive around all 48 states of the contiguous U.S. looking for a new place to call home. We moved to Portland and not too many years passed before we got it into our heads that we needed to travel around the world. When we are not traveling we sit in front of our computers designing and building websites and things.</p>

							<p class="body-text-first">I was born and raised in the Chicago area and schooled in the cornfields 150 miles to the south. I started out studying engineering but somehow ended up with a couple of degrees in philosophy. I moved to Boston at the dawn of the internet age and started designing and building websites which I’ve been doing on and off ever since.</p>
							<p class="body-text">Until I was in college I had never been on an airplane or traveled outside Illinois except to go fishing in Wisconsin or Minnesota in the summer. This wasn’t by choice, I was an avid reader of the Fleming Bond novels and international travel was never far from my thoughts. It wasn’t until my junior year in college, despite much parental resistance and thanks to too-easy-to acquire credit cards that I finally left my all-to-familiar surroundings and spent the year abroad studying in France. The train to the East Coast, my first time in an airplane, and then living in France — it was all so mind-expanding and enthralling that I vowed that I would live abroad one day and see as much of the world as I possibly could before I got too old. But alas, college debt and all the rest got in the way, so it took another 10 years before I was in a position to start traveling again, which just so happened to coincide with meeting Emily whose desire to travel was more than a match for my own — and off we went.</p>
